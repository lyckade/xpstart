#xpstart - a better way to start X-Plane

## Description
X-Plane 10 don't load the sceneries in alphabetic order. Cause of this the scenery designer don't have any possibilities to say when x-plane should load a scenery.

Specially with the new default airports it is necessery to have a programm which orders the sceneries on a way which makes sence.

## Classes
### Layergroup
Every scenery will be added to exactly one layergroup. There is a default layergroup which can be overwritten to a user action.
### Scenery
A class which collects information about a x-plane scenery. The information is about objects, and the apt.dat definition.
