{"name":"xpstart","tagline":"A script for a better x-plane start","body":"# Idea\r\nX-Plane 10 is a very good flightsimulator. It runs on all operating systems and makes really a lot of fun. But there are some things missing. Specially the administration of sceneries is not good solved at the moment. Here xpstart can take care about the order x-plane loads the sceneries. Therefore the user should use xpstart to start x-plane and everything should handled automaticly.\r\n\r\n# The situation in X-Plane\r\nBut what is the problem? For this we need to look a little bit closer to the different sceneries. Not every scenery does the same. There is for example an airport scenery. Here are information about objects like buildings and taxi- or runways. \r\n\r\nThere are automatic generated sceneries with thousands of objects or phototextures. Now there are also a lot of default airports in the x-plane world. These different kinds of sceneries are ordered by the time of the installation or in alphabetic order. Normally it works, but it can causes some conflicts.\r\n\r\nIt doesn't matter if Munich Airport loaded before London or Amsterdam, but the airport of munich should be loaded after the phototexture of Germany.\r\n\r\nThat the different kind of sceneries are loaded in correct orders we need to group them. A group of sceneries in xpstart are called layer. \r\n\r\n# Layers\r\n\r\nX-Plane sceneries can be grouped what they do. It is important that the groups are loaded in the correct order. The following groups are ordered the way x-plane should load them: \r\n\r\n\r\n* **library**: A library is part of the custom scenery folder. It just has objects inside, which can be used by other sceneries. These is the only group where it doesn't matter when it is loaded.\r\n* **ground**: Defines the ground mesh of the x-plane world. If there would be a custom scenery just with a mesh inside it should be loaded with that group.\r\n* **texture**: The photot sceneries e.g. from simheaven.com, are sceneries just with textures inside. \r\n* **autogen**: Automatic generated sceneries mostly from OpenStreetMap.\r\n* **default**: The x-plane default sceneries.\r\n* **exclusion**: Exclusion sceneries just have exclusions inside. Thesese sceneries are necessary, when a custom scenery don't have any exclusions. That there are no problems it is the easiest way to make a scenery just with exclusions inside.\r\n* **custom**: Custom sceneries for airports or other landmarks.\r\n\r\n# Installation\r\n* Make sure that python is installed on your computer\r\n* Just unzip the repository and copy it to the root folder of x-plane. To start just click on the xpstart.py file.\r\n\r\n# Power to the scenery creators\r\n\r\nIn x-plane there is no possibility for the scenery creator to define, when it would be the best moment, when x-plane should initialize that scenery. Specially for libraries, photsceneries or autogen sceneries this possibility would be very useful. \r\n\r\nThat xpstart orders a scenery to a different layer there is the possibility to define it inside the scenery folder. To do this a textfile `scenery.txt` should be added inside the scenery folder. To define the layer the command `LAYERGROUP layername` has to be added to the file. For example `LAYERGROUP autogen` would order that scenery after the textures but before the default airports.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
