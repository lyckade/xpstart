{"name":"xpstart","tagline":"A script for a better x-plane start","body":"# Idea\r\nX-Plane 10 is a very good flightsimulator. It runs on all operating systems and makes really a lot of fun. But there are some things missing. Specially the administration of sceneries is not good solved at the moment. Here xpstart can take care about the order x-plane loads the sceneries. Therefore the user should use xpstart to start x-plane and everything should handled automaticly.\r\n\r\n# The situation in X-Plane\r\nBut what is the problem? For this we need to look a little bit closer to the different sceneries. Not every scenery does the same. There is for example an airport scenery. Here are information about objects like buildings and taxi- or runways. There are automatic generated sceneries with thousands of objects or phototextures. Now there are also a lot of default airports in the x-plane world. These different kinds of sceneries are ordered by the time of the installation or in alphabetic order. Normally it works, but it can causes some conflicts.\r\n\r\nIt doesn't matter if Munic Airport loaded before London or Amsterdam, but the airport of munic should be loaded after the phototexture of Germany.\r\n\r\n# Layers\r\n\r\nX-Plane sceneries can be grouped what they do. It is important that the groups are loaded in the correct order. The following groups are ordered the way x-plane should load them: \r\n\r\n\r\n* **library**: A library is part of the custom scenery folder. It just has objects inside, which can be used by other sceneries. These is the only group where it doesn't matter when it is loaded.\r\n* **ground**: Defines the ground mesh of the x-plane world. If there would be a custom scenery just with a mesh inside it should be loaded with that group.\r\n* **texture**: The photot sceneries e.g. from simheaven.com, are sceneries just with textures inside. \r\n* **autogen**: Automatic generated sceneries mostly from OpenStreetMap.\r\n* **default**: The x-plane default sceneries.\r\n* **exclusion**: Exclusion sceneries just have exclusions inside. Thesese sceneries are necessary, when a custom scenery don't have any exclusions. That there are no problems it is the easiest way to make a scenery just with exclusions inside.\r\n* **custom**: Custom sceneries for airports or other landmarks.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
