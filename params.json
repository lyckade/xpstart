{"name":"Xpstart","tagline":"A script for a better x-plane start","body":"# Idea\r\nX-Plane 10 is a very good flightsimulator. It runs on all operating systems and makes really a lot of fun. But there are some things missing. Specially the administration of sceneries is not good solved at the moment. There is no gui which helps the user with the scenery administration. Also all sceneries are handled the same way. \r\n\r\n#xpstart - a better way to start X-Plane\r\n\r\n## Description\r\nX-Plane 10 don't load the sceneries in alphabetic order. Cause of this the scenery designer don't have any possibilities to say when x-plane should load a scenery.\r\n\r\nSpecially with the new default airports it is necessery to have a programm which orders the sceneries on a way which makes sence.\r\n\r\nFor this xpstart reorders the sceneries over the scenery_packs.ini file. Documentation can be found at [http://developer.x-plane.com/2012/09/scenery-packs-the-new-rules/](http://developer.x-plane.com/2012/09/scenery-packs-the-new-rules/)\r\n\r\n## Layers\r\n\r\nX-Plane sceneries can be grouped what they do. It is important that the groups are loaded in the correct order. The following groups are ordered the way x-plane should load them: \r\n\r\n\r\n* **library**: A library is part of the custom scenery folder. It just has objects inside, which can be used by other sceneries. These is the only group where it doesn't matter when it is loaded.\r\n* **ground**: Defines the ground mesh of the x-plane world. If there would be a custom scenery just with a mesh inside it should be loaded with that group.\r\n* **texture**: The photot sceneries e.g. from simheaven.com, are sceneries just with textures inside. \r\n* **autogen**: Automatic generated sceneries mostly from OpenStreetMap.\r\n* **default**: The x-plane default sceneries.\r\n* **exclusion**: Exclusion sceneries just have exclusions inside. Thesese sceneries are necessary, when a custom scenery don't have any exclusions. That there are no problems it is the easiest way to make a scenery just with exclusions inside.\r\n* **custom**: Custom sceneries for airports or other landmarks.\r\n\r\n## Classes\r\n### Layergroup\r\nEvery scenery will be added to exactly one layergroup. There is a default layergroup which can be overwritten to a user action.\r\n### Scenery\r\nA class which collects information about a x-plane scenery. The information is about objects, and the apt.dat definition.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
